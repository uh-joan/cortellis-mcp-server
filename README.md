## Setup

### Environment Variables
The server requires Cortellis API credentials:

```env
CORTELLIS_USERNAME=your_username
CORTELLIS_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Installing on Claude Desktop
Before starting make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your desktop for `npx` to work.
1. Go to: Settings > Developer > Edit Config

2. Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cortellis": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@uh-joan/mcp-server-cortellis"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CORTELLIS_USERNAME": "your_username",
        "CORTELLIS_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop and start exploring drug development data!

## Build (for devs)

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

For local development, create a `.env` file with your credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
npm run start
```

## Docker
